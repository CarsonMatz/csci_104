Problem 1:
	Line 249
	Both indices of invaders were invaderRow. Later on, though, the second index was invaderCol.
	I changed invaders[invaderRow][invaderRow] to invaders[invaderRow][invaderCol].

Problem 2:
	Line 27
	There was a semicolon after the for statement.
	I deleted the semicolon.

Problem 3:
	Line 62
	There is no code to update the colIdx variable so it remains 0 and then the condition is always true.
	I added colIdx++ to the for loop.

Problem 4:
	Line 218
	The deallocation call for protectors was the same as invaders with n rows and m columns even though they are sideways.
	I switched m and n in the deallocation call for invaders.
